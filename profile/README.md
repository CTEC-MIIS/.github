# The Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism
## Middlebury Institute of International Studies

Welcome to the official Github page for CTEC!
### Who we are :point_down:
CTEC is a mixed-methods research center, meaning that our experts and students use analytic tradecraft, data science, and linguistics. We mentor our students and the wider MIIS community on skills that are in demand from government agencies, international organizations, technology companies, and financial institutions.

### What we do :point_down:
CTEC builds teams of highly skilled extremism analysts to identify trends in violent extremist behavior. This includes:
* Mapping transnational linkages between extremist movements;
* Identifying clandestine networks of actors engaged in behavior like coordinated hate, violence, and large-scale radicalization; 
* Near real-time monitoring of the coded language and symbolism for the purpose of evading content moderation systems;
* Investigating extremism in languages including (but not limited to) Arabic, Russian, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.

After investigation, our teams can provide intelligence reports, threat assessments, enriched data, network-level statistical analysis, and policy recommendations in line with platform expectations.
